OggettoFiscaleBusiness --inherit--> GestioneAnagrafica -----implement----> PersistenceManagerSupport

OggettoFiscaleBusiness --inherit--> PersistenceEntityManager


BeanFiscalOnePostProcessor ---implement---> ApplicationContextAware
BeanFiscalOnePostProcessor ---implement---> BeanPostProcessor

BeanFiscalOnePostProcessor creates an instance of PersistenceEntityManager and
inject it into the business class that are implementing PersistenceManagerSupport. 
You can see that PersistenceEntityManager is extended by some other detached "Manager" class like
OggettoFiscaleManager, this because usually we need to implement some custom query that cannot be 
centralized in GestioneAnagrafica

Appendix:
ApplicationContextAware - used to access bean (i.e. applicationContext.get("bean"))
BeanPostProcessor - is applied on each bean that is being created, in order to alter/modify its status 
just before/after it initialization
