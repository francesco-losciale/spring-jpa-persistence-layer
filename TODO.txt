Short term TODOs:

- add logging using spring aop and method's profiling but only at domain level







Long term TODOs: 

- SOFT DELETION implementation's considerations: 

	Entity soft deletion has been implemented using the @Where annotation provided by Hibernate 
	although this isn't the best solution.
	We want to get a pure JPA architecture not coupled with a specific provider. 
	Soft deletion should be a new feature of next Spring Data JPA releases so we could rely on them
	in the near future.
