Short term TODOs:

- add logging using spring aop and method's profiling but only at domain level

- implement paginator using query criteria

Long term TODOs: 

- SOFT DELETION implementation's considerations: 

	Entity soft deletion has been implemented using the @Where annotation provided by Hibernate but this isn't the best solution.
	We want to get a pure JPA architecture done but not coupled with a specific provider. 
	Soft deleting should be a feature added in next Spring Data JPA releases.

- let the using of 2nd level cache possible
