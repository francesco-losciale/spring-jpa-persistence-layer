This is a totally reusable smart Spring Data JPA infrastructure.

Please provide a MySql database that could satisfy the following client connection url:

jdbc:mysql://address=(protocol=tcp)(host=localhost)(port=3306)/manager_db?useLegacyDatetimeCode=false&amp&serverTimezone=UTC

Or change freely the configurations in AppConfigReading and AppConfigWriting to run the tests.
